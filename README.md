# Roadmap

This project defines topics a member of Emotion should be familiar with.  
Topics are presented from the easy-basic one to the more complex one.  

The topics are composed in the modular way. Which mean you position yourself in the company based on the modules you get familiar with. Basic modules - first, more complex ones - on the top of the basic ones. That's how you build your knowledge.

Do not repeat a topic within different modules while adding the new. Simply pick the module which is the best fit and place the topic there. If such placement is not possible then split the topic into smaller parts and place each to the best-fit module.

You are welcome to discuss the topics found here within Slack workspace of Emotion. ;)

## Basic non-technical communicating to technical

You should not make to a non-technical member position that directly communicates to technical member without completing this module. For example, non-technical people like HR and lawyers are ok without this module. However, project managers directly communicating to technical staff, or technical staff by itself must know this. This is so due to the fact that sometimes near-technical managers do some basic technical tasks that require a bit deeper technical knowledge. For example, project managers accept articatcs produced by technical people and performs some basic tasks on these (e.g. finds occurences of the specific text pattern in a given file, replaces a text, checks if the file provided by the customer is valid, etc.). We need the common ground between non-technical and technical people. And here it is.
